The GATK module includes all the reccomennded tools described from the Germline short variant discovery (SNPs + Indels workflow). This module automates 11 processes including recalibration against known common variants, variant calling (HaplotypeCaller), convolutional neural network variant scoring and filtering to produce a list of high quality variants. In contrast, the Freebayes module utilises a bayesian approach which then filters variants based on quality scores and depth (https://github.com/ekg/freebayes).\n\n","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"69db52647fc1c3a78c54f4f6748a9b4f","permalink":"/publication/germline_variant/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/germline_variant/","section":"publication","summary":"Our germline variant calling pipeline has been created in-house utilising Freebayes in addition to the GATK haplotype caller workflow.

This pipeline is composed of 3 main parts; the first 2 parts analyses files using 2 independent variant callers from Sanger and GATK.\n\nThe Sanger pipelines cgpWXS and cgpWGS were designed for exome and WGS, respectively (https://github.com/cancerit). Both Sanger pipelines utilise CAVeMAN and Pindel to call single base substitutions (SBSs) and insertions-deletions (indels) which are annotated by VAGrENT. CgpWGS also includes BRASS and ascatNgs for breakpoint and copy number analysis. Both tools identify high quality variants that are used downstream for further analysis.\n\nThe GATK pipeline was developed in-house and include all the reccomennded tools described in the the mutect2 GATK workflow. This pipeline automates 10 processes including recalibration against known common variants, variant calling (mutect2), contamination calculation and filtering variants to produce a list of high quality variants.\n\nThe final part of our pipeline creates an overlap between the variants found in both Sanger and GATK variant callers. A html report is created from the results that includes annotated variants significantly different between normal and tumor samples, variant class summary (E.g. nosense, stop codon, etc) across samples, cancer drug prediction and variant allele frequencies - an example of this is shown in the colorectal cancer tumoroid project [here](put inthe hhtps when ready)\n","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"9c35a0fe6c0816bf2f48df420df2c9e5","permalink":"/publication/somatic_variant/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/somatic_variant/","section":"publication","summary":"Following the sample QC, our somatic pipeline can be performed on tumor-normal matched samples.

Sequencing errors can impact downstream analyses of samples including gene expression and single base substitutions and insertions-deletions (indels) calling. The majority of these downstream analyses do not perform filtering steps or provide tools for QC, therefore these sequencing artefacts are required to be filtered out to prevent inaccurate results.\n\n\nWe have developed pipelines that include the all the essential QC tools for both RNA and DNA (variant exome and WGS) sequencing experiments - summarised in figure 1. Irrespective of sample type, samples are first trimmed using TrimGalore, analysed by FastQC and aligned (cgpMAP and HISAT2 for DNA and RNA, respectively). The picard toolkit suite is also used to remove PCR and optical duplicates, give read insert sizes and alignment statistics.\n\n\nAdditional tools have been included to estimate the levels of contamination (verifyBAMID), relatedness scores and ancestry estimation in DNA-seq samples (Somalier) - shown in figure 2. These analsyes allow the identification of samples that may have been mislabelled, contaminated or degraded thus preventing errouneous result interepretation.\n\nOnce all analyses have been performed, multiQC is used to create QC plots reporting results in an easy and digestible format.
