This position facilitated my understanding in a wide range of sequencing technologies and analyses; including CAGE, ChIP, ATAC and RNA-seq. Since starting my position at UEA, I have continued to develop my skills in bioinformatics and analysing samples for DNA variants.

Given that germline mutagenesis is a fundamental biological process driving heritable genetic variation, identifying germline variants which attribute to a particular disease can be a challenging task. We have developed a germline variant discovery pipeline that utilises two independent variant callers; GATK Haplotype caller and Freebayes (Figure 2). This pipeline accepts both exome and whole genome sequencing data, in addition to an optional pedigree (PED) file to allow overlap between disease affected/unaffected family members.\n\nFigure 2 - A flowchart depicting UEA MED genomics QC and germline pipeline.\n\nThe GATK module includes all the recommended tools described from the Germline short variant discovery (SNPs + Indels workflow). This module automates 11 processes including recalibration against known common variants, variant calling (HaplotypeCaller), convolutional neural network variant scoring and filtering to produce a list of high quality variants. In contrast, our Freebayes module utilises a bayesian approach which then filters variants based on quality scores and depth (https://github.com/ekg/freebayes).\n\n    Plotly.d3.json(\"plotly2.json\", function(err, fig) { Plotly.plot('plotly2.json', fig.data, fig.layout, {responsive: true}); });  Figure 2 - an exmaple of SIFT prediction of deleteriousness for variants. Part of the germline variant pipeline.\n\nNext, variants called by GATK haplotype caller and Freebayes are overlapped and annotated using variant effect predictor (VEP). Common variants are filtered using the GnomAD database for sequencing data using user define cut off values; SIFT and PolyPhen are used to predict the deleteriousness of variant (figure 2). A user-friendly html report is created providing interactive tables and plots allowing users to interrogate the new rare-variant results - an example of this report can be found here in the Cholesteatoma project we have recently processed (as of Sept 2020).\n\n\n","date":1599436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599436800,"objectID":"69db52647fc1c3a78c54f4f6748a9b4f","permalink":"/publication/germline_variant/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/germline_variant/","section":"publication","summary":"Our germline variant calling pipeline has been created in-house utilising Freebayes and the GATK rare variant discover workflow.

This pipeline utilises two independent variant callers from Sanger and GATK.\n\nThe Sanger pipelines cgpWXS and cgpWGS were designed for exome and WGS, respectively (https://github.com/cancerit). Both Sanger pipelines utilise CAVeMAN and Pindel to call single base substitutions (SBSs) and insertions-deletions (indels) which are annotated by VAGrENT. CgpWGS also includes BRASS and ascatNgs for breakpoint and copy number analysis. Both tools identify high quality variants that are used downstream for further analysis.\n\nThe GATK pipeline was developed in-house and includes the recommended tools described in the the mutect2 GATK workflow. This pipeline automates 10 processes including recalibration against known common variants, variant calling (mutect2), contamination calculation and filtering variants to produce a list of high quality variants.\n\nThe final part of the somatic variant pipeline creates an overlap between the variants found in both Sanger and GATK variant callers.

Failure to remove such artefacts can negatively impact upon downstream analyses and produce erroneous conclusions. The majority of these downstream analyses do not perform filtering steps or provide tools for QC, therefore these sequencing artefacts should be filtered out to prevent inaccurate results.\n\nFigure 1 - QC pipeline flowchart.\n\nWe have developed pipelines that include the all the essential QC tools for both RNA and DNA (variant exome and WGS) sequencing experiments - summarised in figure 1. Irrespective of sample type, samples are first trimmed using TrimGalore, analysed by FastQC and aligned (cgpMAP and HISAT2 for DNA and RNA, respectively). The picard toolkit suite is also used to remove PCR and optical duplicates, give read insert sizes and alignment statistics.\n\nAdditional tools have been included to estimate the levels of contamination (verifyBAMID), relatedness scores and ancestry estimation in DNA-seq samples (Somalier) - shown in figure 2. These analsyes allow the identification of samples that may have been mislabelled, contaminated or degraded thus preventing errouneous result interepretation.\n\nOnce all analyses have been performed, multiQC is used to create QC plots reporting results in an easy and digestible format. An example of a multiQC report is here.
