My PhD focused on mathematical modelling of the p53 gene regulatory network and in particular integrating models and experiment data. I was employed as a Bioinformatics Officer at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in Sutton for over six years before moving to the University of East Anglia to lead the bioinformatics team within the Cancer Genetics group in September 2013.
