Welcome to *UEA MED Genomics!*

We specialise in the bioinformatics analyses of sequencing data. Our facility is based at the Bob Champion Research and Education Building (BCRE) within the Norwich research park. The BCG is a new service (sept 2020) provided by UEA to facilitate analyses of complex sequencing datasets to aid ongoing and  high impact research. 

At BCG we have developed pipelines that automate essential quality control (QC) measures to ensure robust downstream analyses. Pipelines currently available analyse RNA-seq samples (mRNA differential expression) and DNA-seq (somatic and germline variant analysis), in addition to bespoke bioinformatics analysis also available upon request.
