title: Colorectal cancer tumoroid project
summary: This project utilised DNA-exome sequencing on colorectal tumoroid and normal organoid grown in 3D culture and were analysed for somatic mutations in order to indentify patient specific drug targets. Here we show some of the analyses run as part of our Exome and somatic variant discovery pipeline.

## Introduction

\

\

Dr Mark Williams provided us with high quality DNA-exome sequence from 3D culture tumoroid and organoid cultures to be processed by our somatic variant discovery pipeline. For this project, we
