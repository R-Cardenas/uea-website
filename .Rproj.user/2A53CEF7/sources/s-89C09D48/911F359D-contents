# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Our germline variant calling pipeline has been created in-house utilising Freebayes in addition to the GATK haplotype caller workflow. We use this in combination with Ensembl's variant effect predictor (VEP) and gnomAD to filter for rare and predicted deleterious variants.

After samples have passed QC and have been mapped, samples can be analysed using our germline variant pipeline - both exome and whole genome sequencing (WGS). For familial based analysis, pedigree (PED) files can also be supplied to allow overlaps between affected/unaffected family members. The germline variant pipeline is composed of 3 main parts; the first 2 parts analyses files using 2 independent variant callers; GATK Haplotype caller and Freebayes.

<br /> 

Both GATK and the Freebayes submodule of the pipeline were created in-house. The GATK module includes all the reccomennded tools described from the [Germline short variant discovery (SNPs + Indels workflow)](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932-Germline-short-variant-discovery-SNPs-Indels-). This module automates 11 processes including recalibration against known common variants, variant calling (HaplotypeCaller), convolutional neural network variant scoring and filtering  to produce a list of high quality variants. In contrast, the Freebayes module utilises a bayesian  approach which then filters variants based on quality scores and depth (https://github.com/ekg/freebayes).
